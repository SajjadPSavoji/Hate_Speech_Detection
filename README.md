# Hate Speech Detection with Transformers (BERT & XLNet)

## Objective
With accordance to general rules of social media platforms, some posts which include hate-speech are prohibited.
This phenomenon is more important in twitter as users can stay ananymose only sharing a line of words. In this project two of the most common Transformer models Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and XLNet.

## Results
Results are grouped under the appropriate model.
